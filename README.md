# Pong

This project is a game run by SFML which represents the widely known arcade game, pong. I created this with the intent of playing a simple self made game and to learn how to create visuals with the SFML software.

To play, setup SFML with the suitable IDE. In order for the visuals to load, change the variable "pathBase" in the main function into the path where the "graphics" folder is in.
